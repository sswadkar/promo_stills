# Parsing for Promotional Pictures and uploading them to Instagram

Uses Selenium to parse through TVLine's gallery of CW The Flash's promotional pictures and parses through them to find updated promotional pictures to post on instagram.

Uses Open-CV to sort the pictures by the number of faces in them to establish an order in which images get posted.

Uses [instagrapi](!https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi) to upload the photos on Instagram.

Put all jpg files in the images folder if you would like to upload multiple pictures to one instagram post as multiple slides.
